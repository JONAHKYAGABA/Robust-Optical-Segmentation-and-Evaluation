# ðŸŒ¿ ROSE: Robust Optical Segmentation and Evaluation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**ROSE** is a Python-based system for segmenting plant images and evaluating classification models using both traditional and deep learning features. It includes:
- Contrast enhancement using CLAHE
- Green region segmentation via ExG and HSV thresholding
- Morphological cleaning and contour filtering
- Extraction of 10+ handcrafted and deep features
- Model training and evaluation (SVM, RF, KNN, MLP, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, CNN)
- Confusion matrix visualization and classification reports

## ðŸ§ª Use Case

This pipeline is designed for:
- Classifying plant leaf diseases (e.g. Groundnut Leaf Spot)
- Benchmarking ML and DL models on plant image data
- Feature engineering research on agricultural datasets
